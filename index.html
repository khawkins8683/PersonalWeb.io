				I am Kyle Hawkins from Boulder, Colorado. I grew up in a culture that appreciated the outdoors and physics.  As I grew up I embraced both personally.  That and a yearn for a new environment led me to the University of Arizona, were I fell in love with Tucson.  Nearby Mount Lemmon offers 6 unique climate zones, so if you ever don't have enough time to drive the 1,000+ miles up the west coast, just do the 30 up Lemmon instead.  
				<br />
				<br />
				I also do math tutoring for calculus in the Tucson area.  See the tutoring section of this page for more information.

			Being fortunate enough to come from a middle-class income in the west I get to ski, snowboard, hike, and rock climb.  I also like things like programming, math history and chess.  It's a fun mix.

		<h2>Best Math Story</h2>
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_theory"><img src="./Images/galois.jpg" id="galoispic"></a>
		<figcaption>Galois, pronounced gow-wa (French)</figcaption>

		<div class="container">	
			<p>
			Evariste Galois was born near Paris, France in 1811, and is considered one of the greatest mathematicians of the 19th century, even though he only lived to be 20 years old. He is accredited with initially developing "Galois" Theory and Group Theory.  The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model">Standard Model </a>(the so to speak "periodic table of physics"), is an application of Group Theory in physics.
			<br />
			<br />
			Galois's, father was the town mayor and his mother was well educated and loved classical literature.  So, Galois received a top notch education, but (probably in some part due to his mothers love for the arts) he was not introduced to mathematics until age 14.  So, one of the greatest mathematicians of the 19th century, who died at age 20, never studied math before age 14.
			<br />
			<br />
			Once introduced to the subject, Galois immediately become a prodigy.  Reportedly he found a copy of "The Elements of Geometry" by Legendre which apparently "read like a novel".  More impressive than reading the novel, was the fact that he absorbed the material.  This led to Galois solving a 350 year old problem, the conditions for solving a polynomial.
			<br />
			<br />
			Unfortunately for Galois, his mathematical education did not go well.  He was rejected from the best school, Ecole Polytechnique, but not before hitting the interviewer in the head with an eraser for being "stupid".  Even worse, the French Revolution was about to break out.
			<br />
			<br />
			Galois quickly got rapped up in the revolution, expelled form Ecole Normale (his less prestigious back-up school) and was arrested multiple times.  This is where he met and fell for the jailors daughter.  One thing led to another, and during his last imprisonment Galois agreed to duel another man for the girl upon his release from prison.  This is when romantics depict Galois frantically scribbling the foundations for Group Theory upon a prison wall.  He probably had most of his work done by this time, but it is fair to say he probably knew he was going to die.
			<br />
			<br />
			Once released from jail, as promised Galois faced off in the duel.  Predictably, the mathematician lost.  This is how a near teenager who studied mathematics over a course of 6 distracted years managed to change the world forever.
