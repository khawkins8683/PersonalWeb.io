			<p>
			I am Kyle Hawkins from Boulder, Colorado. I grew up in a culture that apreciated the outdoors and physics.  As I grew up I embraced both personally.  That and a yearn for a new enviroment lead me to the University of Arizona, were I fell in love with Tucson.  Near by mount. Lemmon offers 6 unique climate zones, so if you ever don't have enough time to drive the 1,000+ miles up the west coast, just do the 30 up lemmon instead.  I also do math tutuoring for calculus in the Tucson area.  See the tutoring section of this page for more information.

			Being fortunate enough to come from a middle class income in the west I get to ski, snowboard, hike, and rock climb.  I also like things like programming, math history and chess.  It's a fun mix.

		<h2>Best Math Story</h2>
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_theory"><img src="./Images/galois.jpg" id="galoispic"></a>
		<figcaption>Galois, pronounced gow-wa (French)</figcaption>
		<div class="container">	
			<p>
			Evariste Galois was born near Paris, France in 1811, and is concidered one of the greatest mathematicians of the 19th century despite the fact that he only lived to be 20 years old. He is accreditted with initially developing "Galois" Theory and Group Theory.  The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model">Standard Model</a>(the so to speak "peridoic table of physics"), is an application of Group Theory in physics.
			<br />
			<br />
			Galois, father was the town mayor and his mother was well educated and loved classical literature.  So Galois recieved a top notch education, but (probably in some part due to his mothers love for the arts) he was not introduced to mathematicis until age 14.  So, one of the greatest mathematicians of the 19th centeury died at age 20 and never studied math before age 14.
			<br />
			<br />
			Once introduced to the subject, Galois imediatedly become a protoje.  Reportedly he found a copu of "The Elemenents of Geometry" by Legendre which aparently "read like a novel".  More inpressive than reading the novel was the fact that he absorbed the material and which lead to him solving a 350 year old problem, the conditions for soving a polynomial.
			<br />
			<br />
			Unfortunately for Galois, his mathematical education did not go well.  He was rejected from the best school, Ecole Polytechnique, but not before hitting the interviewer in the head with an erasor for being "stupid".  Even worse, the French Reveolution was about to break out.
			<br />
			<br />
			Galois quickly got rapped up in the revolution, expeled form Ecole Normale, and was arrested multiple times.  This is where aparently he met and fell fond for the jailors daughtor.  One thing lead to another and another and durring his last imprisonment Galois agreed to duel someone (for the girl) upon his release.  This is when romatics depict Galois frantically scribling the foundations upon a prison wall.  He probably had most of his work done by this time, but it is fair to say he probably knew he was going to die.
			<br />
			<br />
			After being released from jail Galois faced off in a duel.  Predictably, the mathematician lost.  This is how a teenager, who started studying mathematics over a course of 6 distracted years managed to change the world forever.
